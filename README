= Search Multi Site

This extension makes the search extension multi_site aware.

Almost needless to say, it requires the search and multi_site extensions installed. They must also be loaded before this extension, but that happens automatically because the extensions are loaded alphabetically.

You can enforce the correct loading order by adding this line to your environment.rb:
% config.extensions = [ :search, :multi_site, :search_multi_site, :all ]
